Authorization

1. User Item Authorization 

Check if the item requesting is belong to correct user by adding user id 
to the filter.

For example, request a user item by id, the filter will become 

{
  _id: id, 
  userId: request user id 
}

Therefore, if user do not own this item can not get this user item,
admin user can bypass this, user id will not add to the filter. 

2. Field Access

Should limit able to access field, by adding limit to the DTO part
